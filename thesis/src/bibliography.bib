    abstract = {Local-first software manages and processes private data locally while still enabling collaboration between multiple parties connected via partially unreliable networks. Such software typically involves interactions with users and the execution environment (the outside world). The unpredictability of such interactions paired with their decentralized nature make reasoning about the correctness of local-first software a challenging endeavor. Yet, existing solutions to develop local-first software do not provide support for automated safety guarantees and instead expect developers to reason about concurrent interactions in an environment with unreliable network conditions. We propose LoRe, a programming model and compiler that automatically verifies developer-supplied safety properties for local-first applications. LoRe combines the declarative data flow of reactive programming with static analysis and verification techniques to precisely determine concurrent interactions that violate safety invariants and to selectively employ strong consistency through coordination where required. We propose a formalized proof principle and demonstrate how to automate the process in a prototype implementation that outputs verified executable code. Our evaluation shows that LoRe simplifies the development of safe local-first software when compared to state-of-the-art approaches and that verification times are acceptable.},

    abstract = {Minimizing coordination, or blocking communication between concurrently executing operations, is key to maximizing scalability, availability, and high performance in database systems. However, uninhibited coordination-free execution can compromise application correctness, or consistency. When is coordination necessary for correctness? The classic use of serializable transactions is sufficient to maintain correctness but is not necessary for all applications, sacrificing potential scalability. In this paper, we develop a formal framework, invariant confluence, that determines whether an application requires coordination for correct execution. By operating on application-level invariants over database states (e.g., integrity constraints), invariant confluence analysis provides a necessary and sufficient condition for safe, coordination-free execution. When programmers specify their application invariants, this analysis allows databases to coordinate only when anomalies that might violate invariants are possible. We analyze the invariant confluence of common invariants and operations from real-world database systems (i.e., integrity constraints) and applications and show that many are invariant confluent and therefore achievable without coordination. We apply these results to a proof-of-concept coordination-avoiding database prototype and demonstrate sizable performance gains compared to serializable execution, notably a 25-fold improvement over prior TPC-C New-Order performance on a 200 server cluster.},

Moving a subtree in a map or reordering elements in a list within a JSON CRDT is challenging: naive merge algorithms may introduce unexpected results such as duplicates or cycles. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for move operations in a JSON CRDT that handles the interaction with concurrent non-move operations, and uses novel optimisations to improve performance. We plan to integrate this algorithm into the Automerge CRDT library.},
