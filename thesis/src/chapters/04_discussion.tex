\chapter{Discussion}\label{ch:discussion}

- Hydration issue in the context of application restarts.
- Partial synchronization.
- Lots of dependent joins in the fixed point iteration. How to optimize?

\subsection{Future Work}

Define and benchmark more CRDTs.

Optimizations in the interpreter. Represent tuples not as vectors but
as overflow-to-heap vectors (smallvec)?

Type checking.

Dead code elimination.
