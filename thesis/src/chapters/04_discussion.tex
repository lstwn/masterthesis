\chapter{Discussion}\label{ch:discussion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Benchmark hydration setting for modeling application restarts.
	      Show that the causal broadcast does not benefit from parallelization
	      as it is inherently sequential by benchmarking the non-causal CRDT
	      as reference.
	\item Benchmark applying just some updates for modeling near-real time collaboration.
	      Again, how expensive is the causal broadcast?
\end{itemize}

- Lots of dependent joins in the fixed point iteration. How to optimize?
- Partial synchronization.

\subsection{Future Work}

On query optimization:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Better join order. How to choose one in the absence of statistics
	      and with static query plans?
	\item Schedule antijoins as early as possible, i.e., if all variables
	      referenced by a negative atom are in scope, then schedule the antijoin,
	      to keep the result set small, as opposed to scheduling them at the
	      end of the query plan.
\end{itemize}

Define and benchmark more CRDTs.

Optimizations in the interpreter. Represent tuples not as vectors but
as overflow-to-heap vectors (smallvec)?

Type checking.

Dead code elimination.
