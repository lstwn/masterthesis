\chapter{Discussion}\label{ch:discussion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Benchmark hydration setting for modeling application restarts.
	\item Benchmark applying just some updates for modeling near-real time collaboration.
\end{itemize}

- Lots of dependent joins in the fixed point iteration. How to optimize?
- Partial synchronization.

\subsection{Future Work}

Define and benchmark more CRDTs.

Optimizations in the interpreter. Represent tuples not as vectors but
as overflow-to-heap vectors (smallvec)?

Type checking.

Dead code elimination.
