\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future-work}

On query optimization:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Better join order. How to choose one in the absence of statistics
	      and with static query plans?
	\item Schedule antijoins as early as possible, i.e., if all variables
	      referenced by a negative atom are in scope, then schedule the antijoin,
	      to keep the result set small, as opposed to scheduling them at the
	      end of the query plan.
\end{itemize}

Define and benchmark more CRDTs.

Optimizations in the interpreter. Represent tuples not as vectors but
as overflow-to-heap vectors (smallvec)?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Support for mutual recursion and aggregation.
	\item Type checking and dead code elimination.
	\item JSON support.
\end{itemize}

\section{Outlook}\label{sec:outlook}

Similar to how queries made data retrieval and storage more accessible to
application developers, I hope that expressing \acp{CRDT} as queries
makes collaborative software more accessible, too.
