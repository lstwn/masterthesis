To my father, rest in peace.
I feel endless gratitude for having had you in my life and for the path we shared.\\

I am grateful for the support of my supervisor, \getAdvisor{},
from whom I learned a great deal about distributed systems and academic writing.
Thank you for critically reflecting my work and offering me your excellent feedback.
Thank you also for your patience with and trust in me.\\

I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of the Rust programming language
for their efforts in making systems programming more accessible and sane,
as well as to the creators of Zed for developing an outstanding editor.\\

Finally, I am grateful to \getSupervisor{} for providing formal supervision
and examination on behalf of TUM.
